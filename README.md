1. (4 points) Find an on-line data source (e.g., from data.gov). Create a data frame from an on-line source that has at least 3 columns.

1. (3 points) test_create_dataframe that takes a pandas DataFrame as input and returns True if the following conditions hold:
   - The DataFrame contains only the columns that you specified in #1.
   - The columns contain the correct data type
   - There are at least 10 rows in the DataFrame.
